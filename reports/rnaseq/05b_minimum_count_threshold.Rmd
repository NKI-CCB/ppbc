Load count matrix:

```{r}
dds <- readRDS(file = here(params$dds))

dim(dds)
```

Minimum count threshold: remove any features (rows) without at least 1 read per million in n of the samples, where n is the size of the smallest group of replicates [@anders2013].

```{r}
table(dds$PPBC)
```

In our case, one group (lactating) is much smaller than the rest.
We therefore choose the lowest n in all groups except lactating.

Minimum n:

```{r}
min.n <- min(table(dds$PPBC)[names(table(dds$PPBC))!="lactating"])

min.n
```

Create index for which genes to keep:
at least 1 cpm in `r min.n` of the samples

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(fpm(dds, robust = F)) >= min.n
table(keep)
```

The old threshold was as follows:
Require non-zero counts in 1/3 of the dataset.

```{r}
old.keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)!=0) >= ceiling(ncol(dds)/3)
table(old.keep)
```

Subset the dds and save:

```{r}
dds <- dds[keep,]
dim(dds)

saveRDS(dds, here("data/rnaseq/interim/05b_dds_filtered.Rds"))
```
