#### General ####

- RNAseq has enough power for prbc but not ppbc-lac. Ppbc-lac is only included in 1 vs rest comparisons and non quantitative visualizations.
- For spatial analyses, insufficient power for prbc and ppbc lac.
- For spatial visualizations of density etc box plots, include all 4 groups but only do statistical test between ppbcinv and nulliparous
- Density plots are now represented as log10(density + 1) for visualization. The log scale handles the outliers much better. The pseudocount is to avoid taking the log of zero.
- Survival analyses (OS, DRS) in RNAseq data either exclude lac or use one vs rest
- For survival (OS, DRS) analyses in spatial data, only include ppbc inv and nulliparous
- Study groups are ordered in figures using factor levels in the analysis, i.e. chronological PPBC (nulliparous, pregnant, lactating, involuting)
- We received the comment that Kaplan-Meiers should include a risk table. Each kaplan meier now includes a (faceted) risk plot. The faceted version is a custom function designed to look like the tables produced by ggsurvplot. 

#### Possible future edits ####

- We discussed TAPC figures are dichotomized into TAPC low (0, 1) and TAPC high (2, 3) because of how TAPC works, but I didn't implement it due to lack of time.

#### Figure 1 ####

1A - Previously was labelled as Inv vs rest K-means, but was actually Inv vs Np hierarchical clustering. This has been fixed.
1B - Previously used FPKM and row scaling to create the IG metagene scores, neither are which are easily rationalized. Now it uses DESeq2's median ratio method and log10 transformation. There were also outliers removed without mentioning that; these are now included. The statistical test for PPBCdl was removed due to lack of samples.
1C - unchanged
1D - unchanged 
1E - The p value is not exactly the same but it doesn't change the intepretation.

#### Figure 2 ####

The Kaplan-Meiers in the code you provided don't match the ones in the manuscript - or at least, I couldn't find them in the indicated location. The indicated figures in the "final edits" notebook were not subsetted to just NPBC and PPBCpw. Additionally, that notebook for me does not run at all: it crashes during group_walk().

2A - Unchanged
2B - P-value has changed to be no longer significant, and test label was misleading or incorrect (says Wilcoxon, was KW according to code). Density is now log10 tranformed with a pseudocount of 1 for visualization.
2C - P-values have changed but not much and the graph looks mostly the same.
2E - The p-value remains significant, but same comment about test labels as 2B.
2F - P-values have changed but not much and the graph looks mostly the same.
2H - I agree this figure doesn't look very nice, but all the alternatives I tried were no better. It's a tough one to visualize. For now I reproduced as is.
2K - The p-value remains significant, but same comment about test labels as 2B.
2L - P-value changes a bit but no significant changes.

#### Figure 3 ####

3A - Almost identical to the previous version
3B and C - P values have changed, just barely no longer significant (i.e. p = 0.052)
3D - P values are identical. I changed the aesthetics to both make it look nicer and make it clear what is being visualized.

#### Figure 4 ####

4A - Appears identical, aside from the order of the groups
4B - Very slight changes to P values (rounding)
4C - Non significant changes to P values
4D - Density is now log10 tranformed with a pseudocount of 1 for visualization. KM looks mostly the same, p values with non significant changes.
4E - Plot looks somewhat different but the interpretation is the same.
4F - Same as 4E
4G - Same as 4E
4H - Lac looks different in box plot, but stat test is only between other groups so it doesn't matter. KM - same comment as 4E.
4I - Lac and Prbc looks different in box plot, but stat test is only between other groups so it doesn't matter. KM - same comment as 4E.

#### Sup Fig 2 ####

2A - Removed filtering for clinical factors that aren't covariates. 
2B - Same as 2A.
2C - Same as 2A, and stage is incorporated as factor instead of an integer.
2D - Same as 2C.

#### Sup Fig 3 ####

I made all three panels look "nicer" and removed the shape variable.

#### Sup Figs 4, 5 ####

No change

#### Sup Fig 6 ####

Slight shifts in significance

#### Sup Fig 7 ####

7A - Minor change to legend (highlighted milk genes in their own color)
7B - I really don't understand what you did here. What is your rationale for removing the outliers, and why are you using fpkm? Regardless, I got a higher R and significant p value whether I used fpkm, cpm, or VST normalized counts. Stick to cpm or VST: the transcript length normalization in fpkm is unnecessary and outdated. Cpm is intuitive, or choose VST bceause it matches the heatmap. I exported the cpm version.
7c - As above, except at least the p value is (barely) non significant.

#### Sup Fig 8 ####

8A and 8B - Slight shifts in p value
8C - Is now a forest plot. IG cluster is no longer significant when including treatment covariates.
8D - Is now a forest plot. IG clust low is significant vs high, but medium vs high is not significant. There are too few samples with stage IV to estimate the HR, which results in an automatic labelling as "reference" - this should be changed in Illustrator.

#### Sup Fig 9 ####

P value in lowest panel is no longer quite significant.

#### Sup Fig 10 ####

Minor changes to p values

#### Sup Fig 11 ####

11A - Heatmap now shows DRS instead of OS (since it's the DRS genes)
11B - Minor changes to gene panels, did not look at all of them

#### Sup Fig 12 ####

12A - Minor changes to p values
12B - Minor changes
12C - Minor changes
12D - Minor changes

#### Sup Fig 13 ####

13A - Minor changes to p values
13B - Minor changes to p values
13C - First panel looks pretty different, but the conclusion doesn't change

#### Sup Fig 14 ####

14A - I am confused about which p value you're showing. Wilcoxon is pairwise, KW is between all groups. In any case, the comparison between PPBCpw and NPBC is not significant.
14B - Slight changes in p values.
14C - Slight changes in p values.

#### Sup Fig 15 ####

NA

#### Sup Fig 16 ####

16A - Added rsquared. Stats change a bit, nothing important.
16B - Same

#### Sup Fig 17 ####

All panels: correlation between IgA and milk proteins is now more significant, but not in a way that changes the interpretation.
