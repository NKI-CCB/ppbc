#### General ####

RNAseq has enough power for prbc but not ppbc-lac. Ppbc-lac is only included in 1 vs rest comparisons and non quantitative visualizations.
For spatial analyses, insufficient power for prbc and ppbc lac.
For spatial visualizations of density etc box plots, include all 4 groups but only do statistical test between ppbcinv and nulliparous
Survival analyses (OS, DRS) in RNAseq data either exclude lac or use one vs rest
For survival (OS, DRS) analyses in spatial data, only include ppbc inv and nulliparous

#### Figure 1 ####

1A - Previously was labelled as Inv vs rest K-means, but was actually Inv vs Np hierarchical clustering. This has been fixed.
1B - Previously used FPKM and row scaling to create the IG metagene scores, neither are which are easily rationalized. Now it uses DESeq2's median ratio method and log10 transformation. There were also outliers removed without mentioning that; these are now included. The statistical test for PPBCdl was removed due to lack of samples.
1C - unchanged
1D - unchanged 
1E - Now includes a rough risk table and exports the risk table data for potentially better formatting.

#### Figure 2 ####

2A - Unchanged
2B - P-value has changed to be no longer significant, and test label was misleading or incorrect (says Wilcoxon, was KW according to code). Density is now log10 tranformed with a pseudocount of 1 for visualization.
2C - P-values have changed but not much and the graph looks mostly the same.
2E - I'm ambivalent about whether showing the delta estimate this way is a good idea, but ok.
2F - P-values have changed but not much and the graph looks mostly the same.
