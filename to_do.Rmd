* Fix the "analysis" column for genewise reports (notebook 12)
* Better handling of multiple ensembl IDs with gene reports
* Update app to include new analyses
* Add univariate interaction models and diffex involution/breastfeeding duration to genewise reports
* Look at clonality in combination with mortality (TRUST algorithm) [Clonality had a much stronger association with survival: the combination of high immunoglobulin expression (that is, numerous plasma cells at the site) and low clonality, which could be interpreted as absence of a distinct antigen-specific response, resulted in an equally poor prognosis as low immunoglobulin expression, while low immunoglobulin expression and high clonality resulted in an average prognosis.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0257-x#Tab2)
(Requires bam files in original version, can we skip with TRUST4? Difficulty installing so far - check Singularity distro)
* Look at MCP with survival
* Mountain plots for Flexgsea (low priority)
* CLIC2


## Odds & ends

ALTERNATE THRESHOLD possibility:

Performs a filtering pass on the dataset to remove any features (rows) without at least 1 read per million in n of the samples, where n is the size of the smallest group of replicates. Recommended in:
