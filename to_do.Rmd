* Rerun the analysis with 2.5% overrepresentation threshold and excluding extreme PAM50/receptor outliers
* Test apeglm via whatever means necessary
* Focus on LRT, inv vs rest, and inv vs non-prbc
  * Come up with a way to discriminate between subtypes (unsupervised clustering of some kind)
  * Start with immune signature
* Try out CibersortX
* Zoom in on IG cluster of heatmap
* Look at specific B cell markers
* Pearson hierarchical clustering approach - because shape is more important than aboslute value - for identifying subtypes - do this on the less stringent filtering
	put the clusters into kaplan meijer survival (library survminer)
* also look at t-sne
* To do: Add two column annotations for the heatmap, showing both group vs rest and all groups separately in notebook 8.

ALTERNATE THRESHOLD possibility:

Performs a filtering pass on the dataset to remove any features (rows) without at least 1 read per million in n of the samples, where n is the size of the smallest group of replicates. Recommended in:
